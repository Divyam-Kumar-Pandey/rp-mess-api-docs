### Code Overview

The code defines an asynchronous GET request handler to send a verification code to the user's email.

1. The token is extracted from the 'Authorization' header.
2. The presence of the token is checked.
3. The token is verified using the `verifyTempToken` function.
4. A verification code is generated.
5. A connection to the database is established.
6. The verification code is saved in the `TempUser` collection.
7. The email address is retrieved from the `TempUser` collection.
8. The email is sent using Nodemailer with the verification code.
9. The response is returned indicating the successful email sending.
10. Appropriate error responses are returned for unauthorized access or email sending failure.
